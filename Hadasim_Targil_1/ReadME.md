## Overview

Overview

The project is a web-based system that manages health insurance members' information. It consists of both client-side and server-side components.
Client-side

On the client-side, the system displays a list of all members in the health insurance fund. Users can view details of each member by selecting them from the list. The member's card displays various information, including the date of their COVID-19 vaccination, the date they were infected (if applicable), and their recovery date. The client-side interface is designed to be minimalist, clean, and intuitive. It supports actions such as adding new members, deleting, editing existing members, and querying the database for member details.

Highlights:

    Utilizes technologies such as React, Redux, and React Hook Form for state management and form handling.
    Supports basic CRUD operations for managing members' data.
    Provides an interface for querying member information from the server-side.

Server-side

The server-side component provides full CRUD functionality and access to the database. It ensures the correctness of input data and prevents errors. The server-side exposes an API for communication with the client-side.



Additional Information

In addition to implementing robust security measures, the project leverages token-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to enhance user access rights. By utilizing tokens, the system ensures secure communication between the client and server, verifying the authenticity of users and protecting against unauthorized access. Moreover, the integration of RBAC allows for fine-grained control over user permissions, enabling administrators to assign specific roles to users based on their responsibilities within the system. Furthermore, Redux is employed for efficient state management, facilitating seamless interaction and data flow across different components of the application. These security measures, combined with Redux for state management, fortify the project against potential security threats and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data.

Bonus Questions:

    Image Upload: Allows users to upload and display a member's picture on the client-side.
    Architectural Specification: Provides an architectural specification detailing the interaction between different services and APIs, along with a conceptual view of the data in the database.
    COVID-19 Summary Display:
        Displays a summary view of COVID-19-related data, such as the number of active cases per day in the last month (preferably as a graph).
        Identifies the number of members who are not vaccinated at all.
