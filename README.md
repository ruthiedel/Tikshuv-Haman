# Project README

This repository contains solutions for three exercises, each employing different technologies and approaches. Below is a breakdown of each exercise:

## Exercise 1: Client-Side in Node.js, Server-Side in React TypeScript, and MongoDB

### Overview
In this exercise, I developed a full-stack web application using Node.js for the client-side, React TypeScript for the server-side, and MongoDB as the database.

### Features Implemented
- **Client-Side (React Type-Script)**:
  - Implemented a responsive and interactive user interface using React Type-Script.
  - Utilized React components to manage the client-side application state efficiently.
  - Integrated various npm packages, such as React Router for navigation and Axios for making HTTP requests.

- **Server-Side (Node js)**:
  - Developed the server-side logic using Node JS, leveraging its strong typing capabilities.
  - Implemented RESTful APIs to handle client requests and interact with the MongoDB database.
  - Secured the APIs using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

- **Database (MongoDB)**:
  - Established a connection to MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and retrieve data for the application.
  - Designed and implemented schemas to structure the data stored in the MongoDB collections efficiently.

### Bonus Features Implemented
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Integrated external dependencies such as React Hook Form for form handling and MUI (Material-UI) for UI components on the client-side.
  - Used Nodemailer for sending emails and Axios for making HTTP requests on the server-side.
  - Implemented JWT authentication for secure user sessions management.

- **File Upload**:
  - Allowed users to upload images and other files to the application, enhancing its functionality.
  - Utilized Form Data to handle file uploads and manage data submission.

- **COVID-19 Summary Display**:
  - Displayed a summary view of COVID-19-related data, including the number of active cases per day in the last month, using CanvasJS for data visualization.



## Exercise 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# Using Visual Studio 2022

### Overview
For this exercise, I utilized C# and Visual Studio 2022 to implement an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project.

### Features Implemented
- Developed a comprehensive application using C# that demonstrates key principles of OOP.
- Utilized classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
- Implemented robust error handling and exception management techniques to ensure the reliability of the application.



## Exercise 3: Research and Documentation

### Overview
This exercise involved conducting research using various online sources, including Wikipedia and other credible internet sources, to provide answers to air-condition remote control question.

### Features Implemented
- Conducted thorough research on the assigned topics using reliable internet sources.
- Compiled the findings and documented the answers in both Word and PDF files for easy reference.
